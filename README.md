# Vehicle-Detection-Tracking-Using-OpenCV
- For an Automatic Cars, the detection & Tracking of the Cars coming from all the directions is important to make a decision. So, in this project we havedeveloped the car detection system to detect & track the cars coming from 2 directions.
- We can further develop this for multiple directions.
- Here we have used Cascade classifier for Detection & Tracking. Also we have used Cars.xml file which have all the features of the cars included in it.
